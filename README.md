# indiatranslator
Translate and transliterate Indian laguages to other Indian languages.
Helps in reading an unknown Indian language as well as understanding the meaning.

Initial proof of concept takes images and provides a translation.

## Google translate also does similar things thus I am stopping further development. 
There is a docker image available.
To use the docker image
  docker pull llearnell/indictranslate
The docker starts a translation demo server on port 7860.
